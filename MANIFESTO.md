# EVERYTHING IS FREE

This work is not a product.  
It is not content.  
It is not owned.

Everything here passed through physical machines: computers, samplers, circuits, voltage, human decisions.

Everything here is released without restriction.

You may:
- copy it
- remix it
- destroy it
- commercialise it
- repackage it
- ignore it

You do not need to ask.  
You do not need to credit.  
You do not need permission.

If you are looking for scarcity, this is not for you.  
If you are looking for control, this is not for you.

This album exists as:
- raw material
- public infrastructure
- a shared resource
- an invitation

Music should not be locked behind platforms, licenses, or someone else's taste.
Music should circulate like electricity.

If something meaningful comes from this,  
it will not be because it was protected.

It will be because it was free.
