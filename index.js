  manifesto: `
EVERYTHING IS FREE

This work is not a product.  
It is not content.  
It is not owned.

Everything here passed through physical machines: computers, samplers, circuits, voltage, human decisions.

Everything here is released without restriction.

You may:
- copy it
- remix it
- destroy it
- commercialise it
- repackage it
- ignore it

You do not need to ask.  
You do not need to credit.  
You do not need permission.

If you are looking for scarcity, this is not for you.  
If you are looking for control, this is not for you.

This album exists as:
- raw material
- public infrastructure
- a shared resource
- an invitation

Music should not be locked behind platforms, licenses, or someone else's taste.
Music should circulate like electricity.

If something meaningful comes from this,  
it will not be because it was protected.

It will be because it was free.

      lyrics: `I peeled off at the corner
Felt the heady rush of virtual wind
Cast aside the garbage I had acquired
Dove head first into the sea of infinite possibility.

I peeled off at the corner
Felt the heady rush of virtual wind
Cast aside the garbage I had acquired
Dove head first into the sea of infinite possibility.

So I moved from the corner
Using  the functions and pipelines provided to me
Round from the corner, asynchronously holding, I waited for me
All the bits and bytes, these very tiny things, these gossamer threads
move alongside with me.

I peeled off at the corner
Felt the heady rush of virtual wind
Cast aside the garbage I had acquired
Dove head first into the sea of infinite possibility.`

      lyrics: `Music, to me, is the most beautiful form
Music, to me, is the most beautiful form

The most beautiful form
The most beautiful form

Music, to me, is the most beautiful form
It moves by you in its own rhythm
It gives you its own time frame
It gives you its own time frame
It moves by you in its own rhythm
It's not like reading a book or looking at a painting.
Music to me is the biggest inspiration

Art is not a mirror held up to reality
but a hammer with which to shape it.`

My relationship with my muse is a delicate one

She comes to me with the gift of song
She comes to me with the gift of song
She comes to me with the gift of song
She comes to me with the gift of song

And in return I treat her with the respect I feel she deserves
And in return I treat her with the respect I feel she deserves

My muse is not a horse and I am in no horse race
My muse is not a horse and I am in no horse race

And if indeed she was, still I would not harness her to this tumbrel
And if indeed she was, still I would not harness her to this tumbrel

My muse may spook
May bolt
May abandon me completely`

There's a broken heart by the window

There's a messenger with letters in the rain
There's a broken heart by the window

From dawn to dusk, I'm drunk and singing
lovesick with every new spring

From dawn to dusk, I'm drunk and singing
lovesick with every new spring

Ice melts in distance streams
I miss your clear voice

Ice melts in distance streams
I miss your clear voice

Drunk we sleep, awake we sing
quite aware of nothing

I dreamed that I'm a butterfly
seeking flowers too

I dreamed that I'm a butterfly
seeking flowers too`

      lyrics: `Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul.
If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.
Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent.
And don't bother concealing your thievery, celebrate it if you feel like it,
It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to

Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination.
Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows.

Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul.
If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.
Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent.
And don't bother concealing your thievery, celebrate it if you feel like it,
It's not where you take things from, it's where you take them to`
